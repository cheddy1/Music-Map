# music-map
Spotify music map is a (almost working) webapp that allows users to sign into their spotify account, take the song they are currently listening to, and place it on a global map.
Users can then look around the world and see what people are listening to.
This project was started for HackKU 2021 but unfortunately not quite finished. Hopefully will be done by the end of the summer of 2021.
